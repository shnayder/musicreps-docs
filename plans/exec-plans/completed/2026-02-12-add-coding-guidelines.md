# Restructure Documentation for AI-Friendly Development

## Context

CLAUDE.md (~300 lines) had grown into a monolith mixing quick-reference info,
detailed algorithm docs, process guidance, and environment-specific setup. This
mirrors the failure mode described in OpenAI's harness engineering post: too
much in one file crowds out the task, agents pattern-match locally instead of
navigating intentionally, and the file becomes hard to maintain.

Meanwhile, the recently added code-reviewer subagent and review checklist encode
coding standards in "verify" form — but the explanatory context (why patterns
exist, how to follow them, when to use each approach) lived only implicitly in
the codebase.

## Design

### Approach: CLAUDE.md as map, guides/ as system of record

Inspired by OpenAI's harness engineering lessons: treat the instruction file as
a ~100-line table of contents, with the knowledge base in separate files.

- **CLAUDE.md** (~105 lines): orientation + pointers. Dev commands, architecture
  overview (pattern names with one-line descriptions), quiz modes table,
  keyboard shortcuts, guide index.
- **guides/**: focused documents that are the source of truth for how and why.
- **Review checklist**: cross-references guides so reviewers can look up the
  full explanation for each check.

### File structure

```
CLAUDE.md                           # ~105-line entry point
guides/
  architecture.md                   # Patterns, module graph, algorithms, adding modes
  coding-style.md                   # Naming, DOM rules, testing patterns
  development.md                    # Commands, testing, versioning, branching, deploy
  feature-process.md                # Plan types, templates, lifecycle
  vision.md                         # Skeleton with [NEEDS INPUT] placeholders
```

### New content (not previously documented)

- Module dependency graph (ASCII diagram)
- Build system detail: readModule() vs read(), concatenation order, ES module ↔
  browser global bridge
- State + Render pattern (explanation and code examples)
- Mode plugin interface (full createXxxMode() structure)
- Factory pattern for testability (createFretboardHelpers example)
- Stats display pattern
- "Adding a New Quiz Mode" 12-step checklist
- Coding conventions: file naming, naming conventions (with tables), DOM rules,
  state management, error handling, CSS conventions
- Feature process: when to write a design spec vs. implementation plan vs. bug
  fix plan, plan lifecycle, architectural review checklist
- Templates: design spec, implementation plan, bug fix
- Vision skeleton: design principles, current state, roadmap placeholders
