# Quiz Mastery & Review Messages

**Date:** 2026-02-11 **Goal:** Show contextual messages above the start/stop
button:

- "Looks like you've got this!" when all enabled items are mastered
- "Time to review?" when previously-learned items have decayed recall

## Design

### Mastery message (during quiz)

> **Updated 2026-02-14:** Threshold raised from `recall >= recallThreshold`
> (0.5) to `automaticity > automaticityThreshold` (0.8). The mastery message and
> progress bar now require both high recall AND fast speed, matching the
> "Automatic" band in the stats heatmap. See `checkAllAutomatic` in
> `adaptive.js`.

**Trigger:** After every answer submission, check if all enabled items have
`automaticity > automaticityThreshold` (0.8), where
`automaticity = recall * speedScore`.

**Condition:** ALL enabled items must:

1. Have been seen (automaticity != null)
2. Have automaticity > automaticityThreshold (both remembered AND fast)

### Review message (when idle)

**Trigger:** On mode activation and after quiz stops, check if
previously-mastered material needs review.

**Condition — ALL items must have high prior skill:**

1. Been answered correctly before (`lastCorrectAt != null`)
2. Have `speedScore >= 0.5` (EWMA at or below automaticityTarget of 3s)

**AND at least one item's recall has decayed** below `recallThreshold`.

This avoids false positives from items still being learned, one-off correct
answers, or fat-finger mistakes on items you barely know. The speedScore
threshold (0.5) means you were answering at or below the automaticity target —
real evidence of prior mastery, not just having seen an item once.

### Priority order

When idle, if all items are mastered show mastery message; else if any need
review show review message; else hide. During quiz, only the mastery message can
appear.

**Performance:** O(n) loop over enabled items, each doing a cached storage
lookup + Math.pow. Even the largest mode (semitone math, 264 items) is
negligible — a few hundred microseconds at most.

**UI placement:** A `<div class="mastery-message">` inside `.quiz-controls`,
right above the start/stop button div. Hidden by default; text and visibility
set dynamically by JS.

## Changes

1. **adaptive.js** — Add `checkAllMastered(items)` and `checkNeedsReview(items)`
   methods to the selector.

2. **quiz-engine.js** — `submitAnswer` checks mastery during quiz. New
   `updateIdleMessage()` checks both mastery and review when idle; called from
   `stop()` and exposed publicly. Message text set dynamically.

3. **quiz-*.js (5 modes)** — Call `engine.updateIdleMessage()` in `activate()`.
   Speed Tap uses its own engine and is excluded.

4. **HTML templates (main.ts + build.ts)** — `.mastery-message` div in all
   modes.

5. **styles.css** — Style `.mastery-message` (hidden by default, green text).

6. **adaptive_test.ts** — Tests for both `checkAllMastered` and
   `checkNeedsReview`.

7. **Version** — v2.4 → v2.5.
