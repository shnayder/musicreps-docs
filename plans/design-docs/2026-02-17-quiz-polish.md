# Intro

The quiz mode works, but feels very sloppy. Let's clean it up. Goals:

- Effortless to use — every interaction is obvious; nothing requires explanation
  or experimentation.
- Logically structured — layout, grouping, and hierarchy match how users think
  about the task.
- Visually polished — cohesive, warm, and refined enough that the app feels like
  a finished product, not a prototype.

# Current state

## Flows

Six phases, managed by the engine state machine (`quiz-engine-state.js`):

```

Within the **active** phase, there's a micro-loop:

1. Question presented (prompt + answer buttons enabled)
2. User answers → feedback shown (correct/incorrect + correct answer)
3. Auto-advance after 1s, or tap/Space to advance immediately
4. Next question (or round-complete if timer expired)

**Escape** stops from any non-idle phase. The × button in the session info row
also stops.

# Problems

## Flow

1. **Speed check derails the "start practicing" intent.** First visit: user taps
   into a mode wanting to drill → gets a "Quick Speed Check" they didn't ask for
   → 10 trials → results table → Done → _back to idle_, where they still have to
   press Start Quiz. The speed check flow hijacks the intent without explaining
   why it matters or letting the user skip it.

   **Recommendation**: Speed check isn't needed for quizzing. It's needed for
   accurate progress evaluation. Move it to the progress tab for now: start with
   defaults, show a prompt to do a speed check to be more accurate. Could also
   show same prompts on home page, but leave that for later.

2. **Phase transitions are instant.** Every state change (idle → active →
   round-complete → idle) is a hard cut — elements blink in and out. Feels
   mechanical, not designed.

   → Per _Screen states are distinct designs_ ("State transitions should feel
   intentional — a visible layout change, not subtle element flickering"): Add
   100–150ms fade for phase transitions. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

3. **Round-complete "soft ending" is awkward**. When the timer expires, we wait
   for the user to answer, but don't signal this in any way. Either stop the
   clock and show the answer or add a "Waiting for answer to last question"
   state.

   → Per _State should explain itself_ + _Label everything_: the "timer expired,
   waiting for final answer" state is invisible — the user doesn't know why
   things paused. Freeze the countdown bar at 0:00 and show a subtle "last
   question" label in the session info row. Keep the question answerable, then
   transition to round-complete.

4. **No way to pause.** Once a round starts, the 60s timer is unstoppable. The
   only options are to keep answering or stop entirely (losing round progress).
   Getting interrupted means wasting the round.

   → Per _Short-session friendly_ + _Minimal friction_: interruptions are a real
   part of short-session use. Low priority — could add a pause button that
   freezes the timer, but adds interaction complexity. Leave for now.

## IA

### Content problems

5. **Context label is cryptic.** During quiz, the session info shows things like
   "±1,2" or "E string" or "maj". These are the scope filter labels, but they
   read as jargon. "±1,2" means the user selected distance groups 1 and 2, but
   nothing explains that.

   → Per _Label everything_: add a one-line summary of what we're practicing.
   "Practicing note recognition on e,B strings", "Practicing semitone addition
   and subtraction: ±1–2 semitones."

6. **Group toggle labels are opaque.** Numbers like "1,2", "3,4", "9,10" or
   "0-1", "2", "3" don't tell the user what items they're selecting. The
   fretboard mode has clear labels ("e B G D A E") but group modes give no hint
   what's inside each group.

   → Per _Label everything_ + _Visualize, don't decode_:
   - label the group selection section of the page: "Select strings to practice.
     Suggestion: solidify E string (justify the suggestion) start on A string
     (Use suggested button)

         e B G D E A  (otherwise stick with that user used last)"

7. **"Advanced" section is vestigial.** A collapsed `<details>` containing a
   single button ("Redo speed check") that most users will never need. It takes
   up space and raises questions: "Advanced what? What else is in here?"

   → Per _One screen = one primary intention_: as in #1 above. Remove the
   advanced section, move "Do/Redo speed check" to the Progress tab.

8. **Recommendation text is absent on fresh start.** When there's no practice
   history, the recommendation area just collapses to nothing. No guidance for
   new users about where to begin.

   → Per _State should explain itself_ + _Action gravity_: pick a default
   suggestion for new users. The recommendation area should never be empty. e.g.
   "Suggestion: start with E string".

9. **Countdown bar and time display are redundant.** The depleting bar shows
   time remaining visually, and the text ("1:00", "0:42") shows it numerically.
   Both are always visible. Two representations of the same data.

   → Per _One way to do each thing_: keep the visual bar (glanceable) and the
   numeric display (precise). If user doesn't know how long the bar was, it's
   less helpful. Could show round length, but countdown seems more useful. Keep
   both. Connect them visually so it's clear they're showing the same thing.

10. **Progress bar label is ambiguous.** "0 / 48 fluent" during a quiz — is that
    this round or all-time? It's all-time, but the context (mid-quiz) suggests
    it might be the round.

    → Remove from active quizzing mode. Not necessary there at all. → On round
    complete screen: need IA cleanup: - Keep context on mode - "Practicing note
    recognition on e, B strings" - Estimated "fluency" display

        - "Round complete". Round details:
            - 5/9 correct in 63 seconds (include "waiting for final answer time")
            - 2.8s median response time
            - <any other round stats will go here>

        - Actions: Keep going / Stop

### Hierarchy problems

11. **Practice card is an undifferentiated box.** Status, recommendation, scope
    toggles, session summary, mastery message, and Start CTA are all in one flat
    gray card with no internal structure. Nothing separates "how am I doing"
    from "what should I practice" from "go".

    → Per _Group related controls_ + _Visual containers match logical groups_:
    add internal dividers or spacing zones within the card. Three zones:
    status/recommendation (context) → scope toggles (configuration) → session
    summary + Start (action). Subtle `border-bottom` or increased gap between
    zones.

12. **Huge empty space below the fold.** Every idle screenshot shows the
    practice card occupying the top ~40% and then nothing. The bottom 60% is
    blank. Same in quiz mode — answer buttons sit mid-screen with emptiness
    below.

    → Per _Spatial rhythm_: vertically center quiz content in the available
    space.
    - For idle, first fix IA, then reeval vertical space.

13. **Quiz prompt competes with the fretboard.** In fretboard mode, the question
    is a tiny yellow dot on a large gray diagram. The fretboard dominates
    visually but the dot is the only thing that matters. No text prompt
    reinforces what the user is supposed to do.

    → Per _Content hierarchy follows interaction priority_ (question is #1
    priority): - add a text prompt above or below the fretboard ("What note is
    this?") - enlarge the highlight circle to draw the eye. The dot should be
    the most visually prominent element. - yellow may be a bad color choice --
    perhaps a darker color? - or making it bigger might be enough.

14. **Round-complete stats float in space.** Three numbers centered on an empty
    screen. No card, no background treatment, no visual weight. Feels like a
    placeholder.

    → First, fix IA as discussed above. → Then, per _Visual containers match
    logical groups_ + _Spatial rhythm_: wrap stats in a card with background
    treatment. Center vertically in the available space. Give the heading and
    stats more visual weight.

15. **Button layout in interval and note drilling is unhelpful**. Just a grid of
    12 notes. Should use piano layout instead, as with notes.

    → Per _One interaction grammar_ + _Visualize, don't decode_: answer buttons
    for note names should use a consistent spatial layout that leverages
    existing mental models. Reuse the piano-style two-row layout (naturals +
    accidentals) for all modes that answer with note names. Already proven in
    fretboard mode. → Use the same pattern for intervals too -- reinforces the
    mental model, map to semitones.

## Visual

### Color and surface

16. **Everything is white or light gray.** Buttons, cards, background — the
    palette collapses to `#fff` and `hsl(30, 10%, 96%)` for 95% of the screen.
    The sage brand color only appears on the Start Quiz button and active
    toggles. During quiz, there's almost no color at all.

    → Per _Warmth over sterility_: add subtle warm tint to button backgrounds
    (cream instead of white). Use sage accents on active elements beyond just
    the CTA. Consider a very subtle background gradient or surface depth during
    quiz. - use interactive process like in the fretboard redesign (in PR 77) to
    explore visual directions.

17. **Answer buttons look like form inputs.** White background, thin gray
    border, no depth. Nothing signals "tap me" — they read as text fields, not
    interactive targets.

    → Per _One interaction grammar_ (buttons must be visually distinct from
    non-interactive elements) + _Warmth over sterility_: Add soft shadow or
    inset effect to make buttons feel pressable/tactile. Slightly rounded,
    warmer background, stronger border. The accidental-note buttons (already
    tinted) hint at the right direction. -> ditto on fast interactive
    exploration of options.

18. **Feedback is just colored text.** Correct/incorrect feedback is a line of
    green or red text below the buttons. No background flash, no button
    highlighting, no visual moment. The most emotionally significant event in
    the loop gets the least visual treatment.

    → Per _Feedback clarity_: highlight the correct answer button green after
    every answer (especially useful on wrong answers — shows what was right).
    Consider background flash, though I'm inclined to leave it out for now.

### Typography and spacing

19. **System font throughout.** No typographic personality. The quiz prompt,
    mode titles, and body text all use the same system-ui stack. Functional but
    generic.

    → Per _Warmth over sterility_ (system font reads as generic/sterile)
    - _Drill-first aesthetic_ (a distinctive prompt font helps the question
      command attention): Import one heading font for quiz prompts, mode titles,
      and the home title. Keep system fonts for body/buttons. Highest
      visual-impact-to-effort ratio.

20. **Vertical rhythm is uneven.** The practice card has tight internal spacing
    but sits in a sea of whitespace. Quiz mode packs content into the top half
    and leaves the bottom empty. No consistent density.

    → As above -- first fix IA: organize things, add labels. → Per _Spatial
    rhythm_: vertically center quiz content. Add internal breathing room to the
    practice card (per #11). Ensure consistent section spacing with `--space-5`
    / `--space-6` gaps.

### Motion and feedback

21. **No transitions between states.** Phase changes are hard cuts — elements
    appear/disappear in a single frame. Combined with the all-gray palette, this
    makes the app feel static.

    → Same as #2 — per _Screen states are distinct designs_: 100–150ms fade for
    phase transitions. Quiz area could slide/fade in on round start. Respect
    `prefers-reduced-motion`.

22. **Countdown bar is nearly invisible.** 4px tall, sage green on light gray.
    The only time pressure indicator is easy to miss. It turns red in the last
    10s but the jump from sage to red is abrupt — no gradual warning.

    → Per _Content hierarchy follows interaction priority_ (time pressure is
    #2) + _Practice, not performance_: taller bar (6–8px). Gradual color
    transition rather than an abrupt sage → red jump — specific palette TBD via
    interactive exploration. Avoid urgency cues that feel punishing; the goal is
    building speed, not racing a clock.

23. **No tactile feedback on button press.** Buttons have a hover state and a
    brief `scale(0.97)` on `:active`, but the visual response is subtle enough
    to miss during rapid-fire drilling.

    → Per _Mobile-primary_ (every tap should produce immediate visual
    confirmation): Stronger `scale(0.95)` + brief background color flash on
    `:active`. Consider a very short (50ms) highlight that makes rapid tapping
    feel responsive.
