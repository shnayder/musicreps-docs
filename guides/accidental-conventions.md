# Accidental Naming Conventions

Standard music-theory rules for choosing between enharmonic spellings (e.g., C#
vs Db). When multiple rules apply, they are listed in priority order —
higher-priority rules override lower ones.

## Rules (highest priority first)

### 1. Harmonic / Chordal Context

Spell accidentals according to the chord or interval structure. In a D major
chord the third is **F#**, not Gb, because it is the letter-name third above D.

_Applies to:_ Chord Spelling, Diatonic Chords, Scale Degrees.

### 2. Key-Signature Consistency

Match the prevailing key signature. Flat keys (e.g., Eb major) use flats for
chromatic notes; sharp keys (e.g., A major) use sharps.

_Applies to:_ Scale Degrees, Diatonic Chords, Key Signatures.

### 3. Leading-Tone Exception

Sharps are used for a raised leading tone even in a flat key. (Currently no quiz
mode exercises this independently; it is already handled by
`getScaleDegreeNote()` letter-name arithmetic.)

### 4. Directional Convention

Ascending chromatic movement uses sharps: G → **G#** → A. Descending chromatic
movement uses flats: A → **Ab** → G.

_Applies to:_ Semitone Math, Interval Math.

### 5. Random Enharmonic Training

When no harmonic, key, or directional context applies, randomly show either
enharmonic spelling per question to train recognition of both. The user should
be able to deal with either form.

_Applies to:_ Note ↔ Semitones (questions, correct answer feedback), Speed Tap
(prompts).

_Mechanism:_ `pickRandomAccidental(displayName)` — 50/50 sharp or flat per
question presentation.

### 6. Sharp Default for Reference Displays

Stats tables, heatmap row labels, answer button default labels, and other
reference/static displays always use the sharp form for consistency and
scannability. These are not quiz interactions, so training both forms is not
relevant.

_Applies to:_ all stats grids (`renderStatsGrid` row labels), stats tables,
Speed Tap stats headers, answer button idle labels (`refreshNoteButtonLabels`),
HTML template button labels.

_Mechanism:_ `displayNote(note.name)` — the canonical `name` field uses sharps.

### 7. Visual Readability

Choose the simplest, most legible spelling. Avoid double-sharps (##) and
double-flats (bb) unless the harmonic context requires them.

_Applies to:_ all modes (already satisfied — no mode produces double accidentals
for the standard 12-note chromatic set).

## How each mode implements the rules

| Mode                     | Rule(s)                    | Mechanism                                                               |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fretboard**            | Sharp default (rule 6)     | `displayNote()` on canonical name; accepts both sharp and flat input    |
| **Note ↔ Semitones**     | Random (rule 5)            | `pickRandomAccidental()` in questions and correct answers; accepts both |
| **Interval ↔ Semitones** | — (no notes involved)      | N/A                                                                     |
| **Semitone Math**        | Directional (rule 4)       | `useFlats = (op === '-')` — sharps ascending, flats descending          |
| **Interval Math**        | Directional (rule 4)       | Same as Semitone Math                                                   |
| **Key Signatures**       | Key consistency (rule 2)   | `MAJOR_KEYS` stores canonical root spellings                            |
| **Scale Degrees**        | Harmonic + key (rules 1–2) | `getScaleDegreeNote()` letter-name arithmetic                           |
| **Diatonic Chords**      | Harmonic + key (rules 1–2) | `getScaleDegreeNote()` letter-name arithmetic                           |
| **Chord Spelling**       | Harmonic (rule 1)          | `getChordTones()` letter-name arithmetic                                |
| **Speed Tap**            | Random (rule 5)            | `pickRandomAccidental()` in prompts                                     |
| **All stats/buttons**    | Sharp default (rule 6)     | `displayNote(note.name)` for labels and buttons                         |

## Why directional convention works for math modes

For the 5 enharmonic pairs in standard tuning (C#/Db, D#/Eb, F#/Gb, G#/Ab,
A#/Bb), the directional convention always produces the same result as
letter-name interval arithmetic:

- **Ascending** starts from the sharp form of the note, and semitone addition to
  a sharp-form note naturally lands on sharp-form results.
- **Descending** starts from the flat form, and subtraction naturally lands on
  flat-form results.

The directional convention also avoids producing "enharmonic naturals" (Cb, B#,
E#, Fb) or double accidentals, which would not map to any answer button in the
UI.
